BP-CHIPCON
=
This is a game console made from a blue pill card. This console use an augmented version of SCHIP virtual machine. The caracteristics are the following:

1. Composite NTSC output.
1. 180x112 pixels at 16 colors.
1. Support original SCHIP binaries.
1. BPCHIP virtual machine is an augmented version to support colors and higher resolution. Many operatings codes are added. See **bpcasm.c** file for information about added codes.
1. Tools to support development of games. **bpcasm** is BPCHIPCON assembler. **cvt-chip** convert binaries from SCHIP games or generated by **bpcasm** in **C** language files for compilation with console firwmare.
1. This is a **GPL v3** licenced project.
1. Hardware is **CC-SA-BY** creative common licence.

First the blue pill card must be hacked to replace the 8 Mhz crystal by a 14.318 Mhz one. This is an multiple of NTSC chroma frequency required to generate colors.

The blue pill card is cheaply available on eBay or the likes. Also available cheaply is STLINK v2 clone. The only other IC used is a 74HC84 quad exclusive or gate. 2 additionnals transistors are needed for serial port interface. This one is only used in game debugging support.

This is the schematic. For a more detailed view there is a pdf and the KiCAD project included.

This is the prototype assembly on a DFRobot card.

This is the gamepad build around a 74HC164 shift register.
This is similar in working ot NES gamepad.
